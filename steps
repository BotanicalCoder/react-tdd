talk about setting up circle ci then setting e2e tests with cypress
then talk about setting up a husky to 1. run the test and do a build before commit and only commit after the e2e test and unit and intgration tests are successful


while setting up my circleci I discovered that my cypress test was failing, but well would fix it, shout out to circle ci

also while setting my circle ci I made a mistake in the config.yml file and the ai helped fix that

to setup circle ci, I had to create an account used github and it was pretty easy, next I created a project, connected it to my gihub and then the setup was somplete

I used the cypress orb, created the .circleci folder with the config.yml file in my project

had an issue with getting the tests to pass on circle ci even if it was passing locally, it was a hydration issue, added a hydration check before the tests runs

Next I will be setting up husjy and using that to add another layer of testing locally before the pr is evn made
